// Program Name: Simple Farm Simulation
// Description: This program is a farm simulation in which objects (representing animals) are looped in a while loop
// until their HungerLevel fields represented by an Integer are 0, which means they are full.
//The animal objects are all children of the parent class Animal and are thus stored in an ArrayList representing the farm
// During each cycle a for each loop is used to iterate over the Arraylist containing the animals 
// Information about each animal is printed to the console using their speak and overwritten toString method
// Subsequently, their feed function is called lowering their hunger level field and then the tick function increases it slightly
//the tick function is used to represent the passage of time.
